Charter Ships is the classic board game Battleship reimagined for clan events.


It houses the same rules as battleship; team captains will place five ships of various length on the board.
The objective for each team is to fire upon and sink each ship of the opposing team.


To make this a clan event, each shot is instead broken into a completable challenge tile similar to "Bingo" tiles in other events.


These events typically last two weeks and utilize efficient hours played or efficient hours bossed as a metric for how long each challenge or tile should take.
However, things like combat achievements, collection logging, etc. can also be used to make challenges or tiles and add variety to your event.


Upon completion of a challenge or tile, a number of shots are awarded to the team. You can choose to hand these shots out individually.
or to the team captain.


Here is an example of a typical game of Charter Ships for a clan event.


## Setup
The host plans the event, setting up ways for teams to compete against each other.
that will reward them with up to 100 shots.


The host then picks or drafts two captains along with their respective teams.
This will most commonly be done through discord.


The host creates a new game and gives each captain a link to the website that allows them to setup their team boards.


The host will also be provided with 200 unique codes. Each code allows exactly one shot.


Each code must be used in order; this is to ensure that events that end in a close race are done fairly.


Upon completion of both captain's boards, the event may start.


## Playing
Based on the host's tiles or challenges, competing teams race to complete each challenge.
Upon completion, the host then provides a code that allows the team member or captain to shoot at the opposing team's board.


When a shot is successfully fired, there are two possible outcomes.
Upon hitting a ship, that tile will be denoted with a red X. If this tile is the end of a ship that was already hit, it will inform users that the ship is sunk.
Upon missing a ship, that tile will be denoted with a white x, indicating no ship is on that tile and that it has already been fired upon.


A team has won the game when all five opposing ships have been sunk.


## Host Duties
As host for your clan's event, keep the following things in mind:


### Verification
To ensure fairness, you should act as a judge for each tile or challenge completed.
Players should upload screenshots of each challenge being completed that are timestamped or dated after the event's start time.
This is most commonly done through the Runelite plugin: Clan Events


### Incentive
Players will more actively engage in events if there is some sort of reward or incentive.
Commonly, this is done through a sign-up fee or donations (yes, even for irons).


## Final Notes
This site aims only to be a tool you use to host your clan event. How you get players to sign up and want to play and compete is up to you.
However, being creative is hard, so if you used CharterShips for a successful event, feel free to send your event's tiles, rewards, etc to the site.
so that others might use your event as an example to build their own.
